The aim is to translate the original children’s story by Denise Stacey, into a short animation through a playful exploration of physical and tactile environments with 2D illustration through practice-based methodology and investigating how these opposing methods can be combined to both educate and provide a rich opportunity to explore storytelling further. The hybrid approach to this animation can assist in positively impacting the cognitive development in children, allowing us to teach them important life skills and topics such as empathy, by bringing the pages from a storybook to life through the use of handmade puppets and objects to create an aesthetic similar to that of a children’s book.",

What if you are struggling and need someone to understand that feeling without having to explain it to them? I want to describe and share the experience of having anxiety and panics. I want to show that it is okay, it is a common experience and that the viewer who relates is not alone in their struggle. It is about representing anxiety for what it is and not minimising the distress. I believe it is important to acknowledge the overwhelming thoughts and struggle and not hide it. Let people talk about the significance of their distress. And if they can’t talk, if they can’t express it in anyway then maybe this animation might help them get a little bit of comfort.",

In this project, the sound communicates the character’s inner state, from chatty women to an imaginative child, a delicate strong man, and an old happy man with hearing loss. We each have our own personality and perception of the world around us depending on our values, experiences, our age or culture. I was interested in looking at how I could communicate these differences by combining sound and visuals together to create rich stories and characters.",

With this approach I hope to help promote the radical plasticity of play (Boluk & LeMieux, 2018) and clearly reify some mechanisms and techniques that can help inspire playful engagement. \nGRASPING uses a novel controller with horror elements that requires a participant to place their entire forearm into a foreboding device. From here, they can interface with Mortalis Institute’s patented helper bond system to receive diagnosis on their arm through an unsettling conversation with an AI.",

For millions of years the aquifer was sealed, plantless and occupied only by stygofauna and troglofauna that live only off the remains of each other (we don’t really know how they can survive like this). The animals and bacteria that make up the ecosystem of the aquifer have hardly been seen. We are only just beginning to be able to sense them through Environmental DNA (eDNA) which is a technique which has recently only made available by super computing. Magnus, the fastest super computer in the southern hemisphere, sits above the Mullaloo aquifer. As Dr Campbell and the team process the eDNA in the water of the Mullaloo using Magnus, the waters of the aquifer flow through Magnus itself, cooling its processors, to be expelled back into the aquifer at 31C, a temperature which may kill the organisms inside.",

          brief: "Festivals in Vietnam are intangible cultural heritage characterised by social rituals such as food making, parading with lanterns, eating mooncakes, lion dancing, moon viewing etc. Due to the rapid development of civilisation and modernisation, these cultures have been eroding, resulting in fewer celebration activities, social interactions, and the loss of oral traditions of passing on stories from older generations to younger ones. Advanced 3D technologies such as Augmented reality (AR) are often used along with gamification and storytelling to draw attention to and engage the audiences with the cultural object. The main purpose of this project is to introduce a working AR prototype representing the evolving festival and ICH through interactive AR technology, and venture to embed natural interactions to encourage people to participate in ritual practises. The project investigates: \"How will festivals and intangible cultural heritage evolve with augmented reality and 3D technology?\" I will construct this prototype based on the foundation of reflective and emergent practice. The methodology includes cultural artefact classification and examination, iterative AR prototyping using game-based approach and interactive storytelling, playtesting and adjustments to feedback, and user evaluation to conclude the effectiveness of the model. The significance of this research will lie in its values to culture professionals and interactive media practitioners by introducing a promising prototype for representing ICH in the digital era. This response will potentially lead to meaningful human interactions with ICH and encourage the practice vital to keep ICH alive through the passage of time.",

But in fact, foreigners may only know that Chinese people will let off firecrackers during the Spring Festival, but they do not know the origin of the custom. Let off firecrackers is to drive away a monster in Chinese legend, its name is nian, It is said that every time the Spring Festival comes, Nian will appear in the mountains and eat people, and will bring disease to the earth. However, Nian is especially afraid of noisy sounds like lions and tigers, so people invented firecrackers to drive this monster away. So I want to make a short animation film about why Chinese people let off firecrackers during the Spring Festival.",

          workTitle: "\"Before is over\"",
          brief: "How to create an adult 2D animation using dark comedy and surreal narrative?\n\nWith the ongoing growth of digital streaming platforms, adult cartoons in the dark comedy genre gain popularity day by day. Despite this growth in a dark comedy directed at adults, there are few examples of these animated works that connect with the lateral, surreal, and absurd, narratives of the dream state. For example, the animated series “12 Oz Mouse”, employs a surreal format, and the storyline develops from absurdist comedy. “Before is over” brings together a surreal tone with the narrative sensibilities drawn from absurdist comedy, to create mystery and thrill.\n\nSurrealism is conveyed in a few ways. Firstly, the bird world with anthropomorphized characters, which is built for this animation is partly surreal. Those characters exist in between human and bird reality. For example, the flat of the main character Lo looks like a nest, the characters speak the bird langua  dream state. It is difficult to distinguish reality from a dream sequence. It creates confusion but also coherence by creating a surreal context where weird things can happen without too much need for a logical cause of a traditional narrative. This effect is conveyed, for example, through unrealistic non-linear transitions from one scene to another such as sucking into the phone or wine flooding in the club. \n\nComedy develops not through overtly directed jokes but through surreal unexpected moments. Some absurd moments are both funny and dramatic, such as shooting at the protagonist with aggressive cats. The surreal approach allows the comedy to arise through such unpredicted scenes. And through such moments, allows us to engage with the universalities of love/longing/want through a different lens, giving us a new view into familiar experiences.",
