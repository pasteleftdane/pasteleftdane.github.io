People will buy firecrackers in the mall on this day and then let off firecrackers in the open space. In fact, foreigners may only know that Chinese people will let off firecrackers during the Spring Festival, but they do not know the origin of the custom. So I want to make a short animation film about why Chinese people let off firecrackers during the Spring Festival，the name is <Firecracker Vlog>",

          brief: "‘Stan & Sven’ combines stop motion animation with children’s literature, to positively help young children understand the complex dynamics of life, in this case depression. The aim is to translate the original children’s story by Denise Stacey, into a short animation through a playful exploration of physical and tactile environments with 2D illustration through practice-based methodology and investigating how these opposing methods can be combined to both educate and provide a rich opportunity to explore storytelling further. The hybrid approach to this animation can assist in positively impacting the cognitive development in children, allowing us to teach them important life skills and topics such as empathy, by bringing the pages from a storybook to life through the use of handmade puppets and objects to create an aesthetic similar to that of a children’s book.",

We AI generated a series of character concept arts and picked one to create character from. Then, we UV unwrapped, rigged, and animated the modelling before sending it to 3D clubbers who created the environment. In the end, we compiled an animation clip with those footages. It was a fun and playful experiment for us.",

          brief: "Festivals in Vietnam are intangible cultural heritage characterised by social rituals such as food making, parading with lanterns, eating mooncakes, lion dancing, moon viewing etc. Due to the rapid development of civilisation and modernisation, these cultures have been eroding, resulting in fewer celebration activities, social interactions, and the loss of oral traditions of passing on stories from older generations to younger ones. Advanced 3D technologies such as Augmented reality (AR) are often used along with gamification and storytelling to draw attention to and engage the audiences with the cultural object. The main purpose of this project is to introduce a working AR prototype representing the evolving festival and ICH through interactive AR technology, and venture to embed natural interactions to encourage people to participate in ritual practises. The project investigates: \"How will festivals and intangible cultural heritage evolve with augmented reality and 3D technology?\" I will construct this prototype based on the foundation of reflective and emergent practice. The methodology includes cultural artefact classification and examination, iterative AR prototyping using game-based approach and interactive storytelling, playtesting and adjustments to feedback, and user evaluation to conclude the effectiveness of the model. The significance of this research will lie in its values to culture professionals and interactive media practitioners by introducing a promising prototype for representing ICH in the digital era. This response will potentially lead to meaningful human interactions with ICH and encourage the practice vital to keep ICH alive through the passage of time.",

For millions of years the aquifer was sealed, plantless and occupied only by stygofauna and troglofauna that live only off the remains of each other (we don’t really know how they can survive like this). The animals and bacteria that make up the ecosystem of the aquifer have hardly been seen. We are only just beginning to be able to sense them through Environmental DNA (eDNA) which is a technique which has recently only made available by super computing. Magnus, the fastest super computer in the southern hemisphere, sits above the Mullaloo aquifer. As Dr Campbell and the team process the eDNA in the water of the Mullaloo using Magnus, the waters of the aquifer flow through Magnus itself, cooling its processors, to be expelled back into the aquifer at 31C, a temperature which may kill the organisms inside.\n",
